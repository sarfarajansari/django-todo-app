# To-Do App

This is a simple to-do app built with **Django** while learning the framework. The app allows users to manage tasks by adding, editing, deleting, and marking tasks as complete.

## Features

- **Task Management**: Users can create, update, and delete tasks.
- **Task Status**: Users can mark tasks as completed or pending.
- **User Authentication**: The app includes basic user authentication, allowing users to sign up, log in, and manage their tasks securely.
- **Django ORM**: Utilizes Django's powerful ORM for managing tasks and user data in the backend.

## Technologies Used

- **Django**: The backend framework used to build the application.
- **SQLite**: Default database used for storing task and user data.
- **HTML/CSS**: Basic front-end for displaying and interacting with tasks.
- **Bootstrap**: For responsive design and styling.

## How It Works

1. Users can sign up and log in to the app using Django’s built-in authentication system.
2. Once logged in, users can view their list of tasks.
3. Users can add new tasks, mark tasks as completed, or delete tasks.
4. The app uses Django models and views to manage and display task data.



## Conclusion

This project is a simple demonstration of using Django for building a task management application. It helped me understand Django’s core features like models, views, templates, and user authentication. The app can be expanded with more features such as due dates, categories, or notifications.
